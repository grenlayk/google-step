      <h2>My hobbies</h2>
      <p>I am keen on competitive programming for about 4 years now. During this time I participated in lots of
      competitions and wrote a huge amount of contests. I studied algorithms and data structures in summer camps and met
      many wonderful people there.</p>
      <p>Also, I really love robotics. I have been learning how to build and program them since my 5<sup>th</sup> grade.
        Participating in different competitions I visited many countries and met lots of people. <a href="robotics.html">
