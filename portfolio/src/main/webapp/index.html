      <h2>My hobbies</h2>
      <p>I am keen on competitive programming for about 4 years now. During this time I participated
        in lots of competitions and wrote a huge amount of contests. I studied algorithms and data
        structures in summer schools and met many wonderful people there.</p>
      <p>Also, I really love robotics. I have been learning how to build and program them since my
        5<sup>th</sup> grade. Participating in different competitions I visited many countries and
        met lots of people. <a href="robotics.html" target="_blank" title="Stories"> Here</a> are some stories and
        photos from my journeys.</p>
